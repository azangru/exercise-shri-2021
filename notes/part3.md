1) Change 1 â€“ the project wouldn't start because of incorrect types in a single file. Typescript identified this file, so was trivial to fix.
2) Change 2 - webpack started with npm start took a god-awful amount of time to rebuild assets. Turned out its mode, if not specified explicitly, is production. Changed it to development. The rebuild time went down from over a dozen of seconds to hundreds of milliseconds.
3) Fixed an obvious mistake intended as a trap for the inattentive:

```
document.querySelector<HTMLDivElement>('.next').addEventListener('click', () => dispatch(actionPrev()));
```

a button with a `next` class was calling a `previous` action

4) A similarly obvious CSS mistake: the height of an element that shows the time remaining for displaying a slide (apparently, slides are intended to change after a certain interval) was specified without the units:

```
.slide-progress-value {
    height: 4;
}
```

Fixed that; plus set an initial `transform: scaleX` value to enable the effect of gradually filling in the progress indicator.

5) The progress indicator stopped before it reached the last slide. The reason was that the stream responsible for advancing the slides based on the had a `take` operator that stopped the stream after an arbitrary number of slides:

```
     const changeSlideEffect$ = timerEffect$.pipe(
        withLatestFrom(state$),
        mergeMap(([a, s]) => s.progress >= DELAY ? of(actionNext()) : EMPTY),
        take(5)
     );
```

removed the take operator from the stream.
